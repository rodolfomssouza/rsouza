I am an Agronomist and Postdoctoral Research Associate. My research focuses on the ecohydrology of natural and agro-ecosystems. I use dynamical models combined with remote sensing products and terrestrial data to investigate the link between water, nutrients, and carbon fluxes and developed optimal management strategies to reduce the footprint of human activities.

I am also a Linux (and Open Source) enthusiastic, and I like scientific programming and data analysis. I am proficient and an instructor in [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="\_blank"} and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="\_blank"} languages, besides programming in [Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html){:target="\_blank"} and [Julia](https://julialang.org/){:target="\_blank"}. My favorite Linux distributions are [Debian](https://www.debian.org/){:target="\_blank"} and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

One of my goals is to make my project's codes (Julia, Python, and R) available for those who are interested in scientific programming. You can find here the public repositories of my recent projects a list of selected publications. This is my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H4jbGCYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="\_blank"} and please email me directly for copies of articles or any other questions.
